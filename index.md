## Welcome to One Minute Python

Python programming is quite easy, but it could be easier if we had access to a graphical interface for it. By the end of this tutorial, you will have accessed your first Python GUI application, and you'll have done so in less than one minute.

### Install Python

**Mac**

To install the latest version of Python 3 on macOS, do the following:

1. Download the .dmg file from [https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)
2. Open the .dmg file and run the installer.
3. To open a terminal window with Python 3 installed, run: python3

Additional instructions can be found at [https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac).

**Windows**

If you want to install Python 3 on your Windows machine, there are a few steps you need to take. 

First, go to the Python website at [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). 

Second, click on the download link for Windows under the heading "Download the latest Python 3 release." This will open a new page with a variety of download options. Choose the one that says "Windows x86-64 executable installer" and wait for it to finish downloading. Once it's done, run the installer by double-clicking on it. Follow the prompts and choose all of the default options. 

After Python is finished installing, open your Start menu and search for "IDLE (Python 3.7 64-bit)". This is a program that comes with Python and allows you to write and execute code in a graphical interface. Double-click on it to launch IDLE; once it's open, you can start writing code!

**Linux**

Installing Python on Linux is usually pretty straightforward. For most Debian-based distributions, you can just open up a terminal window and type 

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```

This will install the latest version of Python 3; if you want to install a specific version, you can add its number after "python3," like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3.6```

Once the installation is finished, you can launch IDLE by typing "idle3" in the terminal.

To run a script you can type:

```bash
python your_file.py
```
